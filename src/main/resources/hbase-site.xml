  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>localhost</value>  
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
    of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
    list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
    this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.

<property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.maxClientCnxns</name>
    <value>1000</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    Limit on number of concurrent connections (at the socket level) that a
    single client, identified by IP address, may make to a single member of
    the ZooKeeper ensemble. Set high to avoid zk connection issues running
    standalone and pseudo-distributed.
